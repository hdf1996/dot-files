# My dot files!

Ya' know, these are my dotfiles, im currently using them on MacOS & Ubuntu 18.04

## Requirements

- ohmyzsh
- tmux 2.1+
- powerline
- hyper
- vim
- this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V7aUT13qtM

## Installation
Just run:
```
git clone git@github.com:hdf1986/dot-files.git $HOME/.dot-files --depth=1
$HOME/.dot-files/setup.sh
```

And don't forget to restart your terminal!

Your old dot-files will be moved to `~/.dot-files/backup/(%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S)` folder

## How it works?
The dotfiles listed on `dotfiles-manifest` will be symlinked replacing your old ones, this usually requires you to restart your terminal.

This will make available most of the aliases, configurations, and sync process, check the rest of the readme for more info

## Aliases

All the aliases are stored on the `aliases` folder, feel free to check them there
